Short Linux build instructions with Code Blocks :

Install Cuda 4 toolkit as follow :

(devdriver is not needed if you have a recent nvidia driver for your card)

Setup nvcc in Code Blocks as follow :

Now to build a plugin for Houdini or Maya, use NVCC as the compiler in Code Blocks, and you have to pass the GCC options with
--compiler-options "gcc_compiler_options"

since nvcc will forward the compilation of .cpp to GCC
the GCC compiler options can be found by looking at the example makefiles in the HDK or the Maya DevKit.

I had a problem using GLEW from the Nvidia GPU SDK which is not compiled with -fPIC, but it works fine using GLEW installed with apt-get

I built the maya plugin with GCC 4.4 instead of 4.1.2 as specified in the maya docs and it seems to work.
